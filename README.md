# AI Stepstone
uploading files related to DL and ML, mostly according to Udemy's Deep understading of Deep Learning.

Edit: Ok I think I'm not gonna work on AI through coding for a while!
well I couldn't delete this repo, and I don't even know what eaxctly is repo! I should take a course on that probably. and I'm writing this on README.md file 
which I have no idea what this is. maybe this wasn't the best place to nag about my unfamiliarity with the platform. but this will be no more! maybe in ten years I will upload some stuff here
related to AI, hope those stuff will make money for me!
